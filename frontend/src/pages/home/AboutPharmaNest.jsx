          When it comes to medicines, most of us do not want to take a chance.
          This is why most of us prefer going to a store physically to get
          medicines. But you know what happens at the stores. First, you need to
          go there physically which may mean a few hours/wait/queue for at least
          10-15 minutes. Second, you need to wait for your turn which may come
          after 10-15 minutes. Third, you can only buy the products you see or
          hear about. What if you don’t get the medicine you need? But we at
          PharmaNest understand your concern. You don’t want to spend that
          precious little free time you get to stay in long queues to get your
          medicines. That is why PharmaNest is the solution to all these. We
          deliver the medicines to you without you having to step out and wait
          in the queue to buy medicines. And we also give you the option to
